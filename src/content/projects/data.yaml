      Sher is a decentralized live audio platform developed by GEUT. It aims to revolutionize how live audio content is created, shared, and consumed by leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies. The platform offers a decentralized approach, meaning it operates without a central server, enhancing privacy, security, and resilience.<br/>

      Key features of Sher include:
        - **Decentralized Infrastructure:** By utilizing P2P networks, SHER.app ensures that audio content is distributed directly between users, reducing dependency on centralized servers and increasing the platform's robustness.
        - **Live Audio Streaming:** SHER.app allows users to broadcast live audio sessions, making it suitable for various applications, including podcasts, live shows, and real-time discussions.
        - **Community Focus:** The platform is designed to foster a community-driven environment where users can connect, share, and interact with each other in real time.
        - **Open Source:** As an open-source project, SHER.app invites contributions from developers worldwide, promoting transparency, innovation, and continuous improvement.

      <br/>
      Overall, SHER.app embodies GEUT's commitment to building cutting-edge, decentralized products that empower users and enhance the digital experience.
