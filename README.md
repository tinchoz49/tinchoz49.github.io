# Mart√≠n's Resume

Welcome to my online **resume**, created using my [Astro Starter Project](https://github.com/tinchoz49/astro-starter), which is based on [devscard](https://github.com/KonradSzwarc/devscard).

This project showcases several key elements I frequently use in my work:

- **Effective Linting**: A customized `standard` eslint configuration with `astro` support.
- **Versatile Web Framework**: The flexibility and power of `astro` for building any type of web application.
- **Robust Type System**: While I have a preference for JavaScript with JSDoc, I am equally comfortable using TypeScript, especially for frontend development.

For a deeper understanding of my work style, feel free to explore the source code of this project or check out my other open-source contributions.
